function f = cicdesign(R, N, M)
%CICDESIGN N-stage decimate by R CIC-filter design
%  CICDESIGN allows decimation factor and number of stages to be specified
%  for the "simulated" design of a CIC filter. The FIR filter returned has
%  the magnitude and phase response of an "actual" CIC filter but not the
%  decimation.
%
%  F = CICDESIGN(R, N, M) returns a filter structure which contains the
%  numerator coefficients (B), the denominator coefficients (always A=1)
%  and the decimation factor (R).
%  
%  where:
%  R is the decimation factor
%  N is the number of stages of the CIC filter
%  M is the differential delay parameter
%
%  To actually use this filter, the data has to be passed through CICFILTER
%  instead of Matlab's FILTER. CICFILTER uses Matlab's FILTER function but
%  will also decimate the output according to the factor, R.
